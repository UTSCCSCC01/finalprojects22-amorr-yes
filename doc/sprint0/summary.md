This document provides an overview of the entire project, explaining the objectives, key users, key scenarios and principles of the final product. Every effort has been made to ensure that this document correctly reflects the team's consensus on the project and expectation of the final product. However, this document is subject to change and may be modified in the future should there be any modification deemed necessary by the team during the development of the product.

## Project Objectives
The objective is to build an web-based platform which connects individual customers to nearby beauty service providers, who will then come to the customers' location to perform the service. The platform allows customers to search for an ideal service provider, to talk with the provider, and guarantees a professional service and a secure transaction.

## Key Personas
Jose Gonzalez, a twenty-eight-year-old hairstylist at Barber Republic. He is a licensed barber specialized in creative cuts. His customers describe him as a caring professional dedicated to the customers' requirements.

Lara Foster, a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. She is an Arts Management student looking for a Co-op intern opportunity.

Eric Lee, a twenty-eight-year-old system administrator.

## Key Scenarios
The Covid-19 pandemic hits the barber shop Jose worked at very hard. The barber shop loses many of its regular customers and Jose's income is also affected. Nevertheless, Jose is confident at his skill and profession. He wants to find himself a part-time to provide a better living for his family. He has a set of hairdressing tool at home and he has always welcomed new technologies like aMMOR.

As a third year student, Lara is searching for her very first internship. She wants a more formal hairstyle for her coming job interviews, one of which is happening tomorrow morning. Unfortunately, Lara cannot find a proper barber shop nearby, and she hasn't got her driver's license yet. She is a stressed and busy student who doesn't feel like spending hours on a bus just to get a haircut. She is looking for a way to get a haircut at the comfort of home.

Eric decides to be the system administrator of our product. He wants a backend where he can easily access the number of service providers and clients in a certain area and manage a large volume of data for approving Photo IDs and professional certificates or licenses.

## Key Principles
Customer Satisfaction - Using filters and sorting, the user should be able to easily find the kind of service he or she needs and a professional who can meet the user's expectations within the user's budget.

Direct Communication - The user and the provider should be able to communicate with each other directly, through a built-in messaging system or other means.

Smooth Transaction - It should be easy for the customer and the provider to make an appointment. Both the actual cost for the customer and the actual income for the provider should be fair and transparent. The platform guarantees a professional service and a secure transaction, and is responsible for assisting dispute resolution, if any.
