# How did you organize the team? 

At the first meeting of each sprint, the tasks are divided evenly according to workload. If some work are related, we tend to put them in one part. Then, all parts are selected or assigned based on each member's interest and skills. 

Sprint0:

- Lingfei Cai: Persona.pdf & Process.md (with Changhao)

- Zhongyu Liu: PB.md (with Changhao), done.md
- Changhao Wang: PB.md (with Zhongyu), done.md & Process.md (with Lingfei)
- Zhenyuan Xiang: User Interface, Setup & README.md
- Pei Zhang: Competition.md & summary.md

# Which tools did you use, if any? 

- We use Discord mostly for communication and meetings, and we have each others' phone number for emergency contact.  

- We use git for most collaborative works and version control. 
- For written notes, we use Google docs to edit together and to share documents. 
- We are going to use JIRA when we get more familiar to it, but all members have set up their accounting and join the same team.

# How did you make decisions?

Regarding a issue that needs decision, most of the time we discuss with team members and product owner about what is the issue specific. We need to make sure that we are on the same page. Also, we reach out to TA or professor for suggestions if necessary. After these two steps, since we have a relatively small group (five people), we usually reach consensus. If not, we vote and follow the majority. But each vote need one to two reasons to backup just to make sure everyone has thought through the problem before making valuable decision.

# How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?



# How many rounds of voting (on  average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?



#  How frequently did you meet? 

We have three meetings each week, and we add more if necessary. Mandatory meetings are: Tuesday 7:30 PM , Thursday 7:30 PM and Saturday 2:00 PM. At the beginning of each sprint, we have a planning meeting (Saturday 2:00 PM) to go through all work in this sprint and divide them to each members. The following meetings are used to 1) solve problems together and give every member chances to tell any obstacles, 2) update each members process and help teammates or rearrange work if needed, 3) approve the final version to commit and planning for the next sprint (most likely at the last meeting of a sprint).

#  What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
