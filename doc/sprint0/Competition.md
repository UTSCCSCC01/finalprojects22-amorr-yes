There are some products similar to Amorr already in service. Below is a list of some of those products that are both mature, and similar to Amorr in terms of business logic. However, not all of those products operate in Canada, and those who do provide little to none beauty service, which is exactly the industry Amorr focuses on. Therefore in general we expect little competition with our product.

I. TaskRabbit
https://www.taskrabbit.com/
TaskRabbit is an online marketplace that allows customers to find labour service including handyman, moving services, furniture assembly, mounting, and cleaning services. TaskRabbit connects individual customers to individual labour service providers (or small organization in some cases) who then perform the service at the customer's location, whereas our product connects individual customers to individual beauty service providers (or small organization in some cases) who then also perform the service at the customer's location. It is quite obvious that TaskRabbit and our product are similar in nature. Yet it is important to note that labour service is very different from beauty service. The nature of labour service decides that it must be carried out at the customer's location, while traditionally beauty service is predominantly carried out at the provider's location. Therefore TaskRabbit cannot just simply expand its service to cover the beauty industry without properly understanding why customers would like door-to-door beauty service and adjust their business pattern accordingly.

II. Gojek
https://www.gojek.com/
Gojek Super App is an integrated platform providing all kinds of services. In particular, Go-Glam, which provided haircut, nail beauty and face beauty services, was the main potential rival of our product. However, as Gojek discontinued that service along with most of its lifestyle services in 2019 and 2020, competition from Gojek ceased to exist. In addition, Gojek never operated in Canada.

The three products below are similar to our product, but focused on different services. They pose little competition to our product for the same reason mentioned when discussing potential competition from TaskRabbit.
