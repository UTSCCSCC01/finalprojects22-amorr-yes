## Sprint Retrospective 1

### Participantsï¼š

Lingfei Cai, Zhenyuan Xiang, Pei Zhang, Changhao Wang, Zhongyu Liu

### Unfinished tasks and group them into stories:

We completed all the user stories of sprint 1.

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:

- Active communication in private discord channel and meet regularly.
- All tasks are clearly divided into subtasks.
- Work are distributed according to individual's experience and interest.

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:

- All branch is created according to subtasks ticket number to ensure that backend and frontend features can be tested without each other (e.x. backend APIs for login and signup can be tested without frontend)

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:

- Regarding git usage: develop -> mainTaskBranch -> subtaskBranch structure result in many conflicts and inconvenience for testing. It's time-wasting and meaningless to handle unnecessary conflicts due to complicate structure. So we will use develop -> subtaskBranch this time.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1

Worst experience: Conflicts with package-lock.json and package.json files

Best experience: We are satisfied with the final product we made during sprint 1
