# Sprint 1 Planning meeting:

- This meeting is held on 4th June, 2022 by using discord. This meeting is to estimate point per feature and allocate tasks to team members. The meeting is attended by all group members. On this meeting, we first make point estimate for each feature. Then we separated tasks into subtasks. Most tasks are separated by frontend and backend. Finally, each team member get their responsibility to work on. 

# Sprint goal:

- implement some user stories related to clients and build up a framework. Finish user stories AM-1, AM-2, AM-3, AM-25, AM- 27.

# User stories for sprint1:

- AM-1: Client signup
- AM-2: Client profile
- AM-3: Client log in
