## Sprint 3 Planning meeting:

- This meeting is held on 5th July, 2022 by using discord. This meeting is to estimate point per feature and allocate tasks to team members. The meeting is attended by all group members. On this meeting, we first make point estimate for each feature. Then we separated tasks into subtasks. Most tasks are separated by frontend and backend. Finally, each team member get their responsibility to work on.

## Sprint goal:

- implement some user stories related to service provider. Finish user stories AM-10, AM-19, AM-6, AM-5, AM-7, AM-17.

## Spikes:

- Frontend: We may need to dynamic display client's order history on service provider's main page.
- Backend: We need to develop an api and data structure for clients' orders

## User stories for sprint 3:

- AM-10 Client booking
- AM-19 Service provider receive order
- AM-6 Client view provider homepage
- AM-5 Client order history
- AM-7 Client browsing
- AM-17 Service provider schedule

## Team Capacity (or Team Velocity):

 Our team capacity (total estimated points) is 106 for this sprint. One point means an ideal working hour of workload.
