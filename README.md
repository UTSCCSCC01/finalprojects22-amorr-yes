## Amorr

Amorr is a marketplace that connects clients to service providers or freelancers who provide a multitude of different services.

## Motivation

For better customer experiences, Amorr allows for the services to be performed at the customerâ€™s residency, eliminating the need for the customer to travel to specific locations where the service would normally be performed.

The services hosted on the app include barbers and hairdressers, makeup artists, cleaners, spa treatments, massage treatments, eyebrows, and eyelashes.

Other benefits include providing customers with convenience, eliminating customer travel time and expenses.

## Installation

Tech stack:

+ Frontend: React
+ Backend: Python (Django)
+ Database: SQLite (Database may be transferred to MySQL in production environment)

### Frontend

Firstly, please make sure `npm` is correctly installed and configured in your system.

We are using `create-react-app` for creating our react app.

To install `create-react-app`, execute:

```shell
npm install -g create-react-app
```

To create the app, execute:

```shell
create-react-app frontend
```

You may encounter such issue when creating the app (if you are using Ubuntu 20.04): `You are running Node 10.19.0. Create React App requires Node 14 or higher.`

To solve this problem, execute:

```shell
npm cache clean -f
npm install -g n
n stable
```

After the frontend app is created, you can start it by:

```shell
cd frontend
npm start
```

You should be able to get access to it at `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Backend

We are going to use `pipenv` to create our virtual environment. Make sure you have `Python 3.8.10` and `pipenv` installed in your system.

Firstly use these commands to create our virtual environment:

```shell
mkdir backend && cd backend
pipenv install django~=3.1.0
```

To activate the virtual environment, use:

```shell
pipenv shell
```

Now we can use the `startproject` command to create a new Django project:

```shell
django-admin startproject amorr_backend
```

Run the backend with:

```shell
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Then you should be able to get access to it at `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

### Database

The SQLite database is automatically installed with Django project since it is a built-in feature in Django framework.

## Contribution

We are using Git Flow model.

Branches:

+ `main`: containing the current working version
+ `sprint0~sprint4`: the develop branches, containing the developing codes that will be merged into the `main` branch
+ `feature/***`: the feature branches, must start with the `feature` prefix, containing the code for new features that will be merged into develop branches

Pull requests:

1. Clone the repository and create a new branch by `git checkout https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/finalprojects22-amorr-yes.git -b name_for_new_branch`
2. Add / modify features
3. Perform detailed tests
4. Make a pull request with detailed description
